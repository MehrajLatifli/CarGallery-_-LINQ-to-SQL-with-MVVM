# CarGallery-_-LINQ-to-SQL-with-MVVM
LINQ to SQL with MVVM.  Update can not work correctly. Because of Combo boxes directly binding with tables of database. Update all same items which selected item in database and listview. Add update item instead of orginal item in combo box. You will not face a problem If use textbox instead of combox.
